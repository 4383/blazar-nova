Blazar Nova related changes. Includes filters for Host reservation and Nova API
extensions for the instance reservation feature.

NOTE: The instance reservation feature does not work currently because it
depends on Nova API extensions. Support for these extensions was completely
removed from Nova in Newton. Expect the instance reservation feature to be
implemented differently in a future release.
